        <h2>Couples and Individual Therapist, MS, tLMHC, SOTP II</h2>
        <p>I have been working in the “helping field” for the entirety of my career. Having started as a prevention specialist, I transitioned to substance abuse treatment and later focused on working with incarcerated individuals helping them overcome and cope with the addictions and mental illnesses that often led to their arrest. In 2022, I decided to step outside the “walls” and focus my energy on helping individuals within the community to utilize resources and support systems in their backyard.  I have found that my solution focused, cognitive approach translates well to those experiencing an array of difficulties, as well as those who are just sick of their own shit. I believe that a connection with your therapist is important, and highly recommend a consultation to assure you feel the “vibe”.  As a sex offender treatment counselor, I can assure you that if you are suffering from porn addiction, I have heard it before and am equipped to help you repair the damage that your desires have caused. Whether you are experiencing explosive emotional outbursts that have damaged your relationships, repairing your self-image following domestic abuse, or want support and guidance in navigating life’s challenges, that’s what I’m here for. </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Ways Therapy Can Help</h1>
        <p><span>Anger Management Individual and Group Therapy: </span>The goal of the ACTIV is to provide guidance to those who struggle with anger by helping them gain more insight into their automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, underlying assumptions and core beliefs and to reframe them as needed.</p>
        <p><span>Borderline Personality Individual and Group Therapy: </span>This therapy helps those living with BPD to develop skills to decrease the intensity of emotions, reduce their likelihood of self-destructive choices, improve the health of their interpersonal relationships, and manage stress.</p>
        <p><span>Couples Counseling: </span>Couples seek counseling after serious issues have threatened their marriage. Infidelity, a feeling that you’re growing apart, unhealthy communication, or no communication at all, frequent arguments, money disagreements, or problems in your sex life are common reasons to consider therapy. However, some couples in healthy relationships attend counseling regularly to continue to improve their bond and interactions with one another. I work with couples and individuals in therapy to promote healthy connections, deepen intimacy, and promote self-awareness. My goal is to work with you to co-create a safe space in therapy where you can feel supported to untangle the issues preventing you from living your fullest life.
